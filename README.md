- 👋 Hi there, I’m Ritesh KC.
- 👀 I’m a neuroscientist by training with a deep appreciation for data and its use to narrate meaningful stories.
- 🔬📊 Over the course of my undergraduate and graduate studies, I've had the opportunity to work on a number of bioinformatics projects, which helped me to discover  my passion for data analysis and data science. 
- 🧬📉📚 I have been utilizing molecular biology toos and large genomic data to uncover meaningful biological insights.
- 🌱 Along the way, I was able to learn programs like **R** and **Python**, which helped me to acquire more experience in applied aspects of data interpretation.
- 💞️ I am always open to learning more and collaborating on interesting projects that involve data analysis and data science and biology. 
- 📫 Feel free to reach out or explore some of the work I’ve shared here. Let’s build something together!
